This desktop app will be used to convert easely timetables to gtfs

Things to do in order:
The program should only take care of UTF-8 files. In input and in output.
There should be a function to verify if stops names look alike and ask the user if they're the same.
Every time the user is asked, the user's feedback should be put in files so that the program won't ask again.
There should be an option to fuse stops by performing a check on the files mentioned above.
Trips's id should be "line-service-tripNumber" two trips can be like "3-W-12" et "3-S-12" without conflict.
There should be an option to delete lines or trips.
Add an option to remove trips which have the same start and end (and service).
